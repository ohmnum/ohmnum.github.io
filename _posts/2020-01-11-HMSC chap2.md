##  Modeling Components
- Study of **Load model**,**Component model**
- Useful in 
  - assessing the change in component response when components are damaged
  - predicting the response of component to loads
- Models : Raw data -> information of health of component
- Two kinds
  - Physical law(Physics based)
  - Measurement data(Data-driven)
- Inertia, damping,, stiffness are included in these dynamic models
- Nonlinear damping and stiffness restoring forces are common
- Free vibration response : sum of the modes of vibration
- mode of vibration : natural frequency + mode shape
- Impulsive(transient) type of exitation excite the free vibration response
- **Damage nearly always behave in a nonlinear manner**
- **Matlab** can be used to analyze dynamic response and **Simulink** can be used to simulate dynamic response of onlinear system.2 
### **Vibration Model**
- describe the dynamic response of structural components to dynamic loads
- Resonant frequencies,, mode shapes = Free response
    - Free response whanges with damage
### **Lumped parameter/Continuous model**
- model Vibration and wave propagation
- Vibration : standing wave pattern setup by interference between propagating waves
  - Lumped parameter model
    - ordinary differential equation
  - Continuous model
    - partial differential equation

### **Frequency response functions(FRFs)** 
- Ratio between the <U>response exitation</U> as a function of <u>frequency</u>
- Describe relative amplitude and phrase of the <u>dynamic response</u> with respect to <u>excitation forcing amplitude and phase</u>
- can combined with **impedance model** for different configurations to describe <u>dynamic response of the combined system</u>

### **Wave equation**
- Describes the propagation of elastic waves
- Used to identify damage due to change in speed of propagation
- **Separation of variables**method decomposes the solution of the wave equation into temporal and spatial pieces
- **speed of sound** is function of modulus and density
  - Equal to the product of <u>frequency</u> in Hz and <u>wavelength</u>
- **Wave number** is the ratio of requency to speed of sound 
  - Represents of spatial frequency
- **Group velocity** can be get by differentiating the <u>frequency</u> with respect to <u>wave number </u>
  - Describes the speed of a group of waves in a certain frequency bandwith
- **Smaller defect detection : Wavelength is small, frequency is high**
  - Smaller wavelengths also results in more relfections from rough surfaces and boundaries
- **Dispersion** : occurs when the propagation energy of a wave front decreases due to motions in other directions
  - Causes <u>the wave front to change shape</u>. Because higher frequencies travel faster than low frequencies
  - Makes it more difficult to identify damage.

### **Finite elemnt models(FEMs)**
- Used to model structure components with discontinuous mass, damping and stiffness properties due to damage or variations in the healthy structural component and geometrical parameters.

### **Direct parameter models**
- Used to estimate mass, damping ,and stiffness parameters from the measured exitation and response data
- Estimated using **least squares solution techniques**
### **Restoring force models**
- Relate the internal forces within a component due to stiffness and damping to mass $\times$ acceleration of the components
- Acceleration is used to construct models, **Restoring force projections** are obtainedㅁㄴㅇㄻㄴㅇㄻㄴㅇㄻㄴㅇㄹ
- **Phase-plane trajectories** relating the <u>velocity</u> to the <u>displacement response</u> of a components are also useful model for health monitoring
  
### **Discrete time models(difference equation models)**
- Model can be estimated from the measurement data
- Advantageous for all response variables are not needed to estimated the parameters.
### **Experimental frequency response models(embedded sensitivity functions**
- Can be utilized to estimated the change in frequency response function with changes to the mass, damping or stiffness parameters without requiring the starting values of these parameters
- Change in the parameters can be estimated
### **Virtual force models**
- Describe the <u>damged components</u> as a <u>sum of the healthy structural components and forces applied locally</u> to represent the damage.
### **Experimental modal vibration models** 
- can be developed from measured data using various modal parameter estimation methods 
### **Load models**
- Different mechanical exitations : exercise component and damage differently
  - Impulses
  - Narrow band cyclic
  - Broadband random 
- Load due to other environmental factors : also important to consider in health monitoring
  - Acoustic pressure
  - Temperature
