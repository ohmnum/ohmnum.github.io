 ## Modeling Damage
 - Quantifying damage levels 
 - Predicting the rate of change of damage

 ### Static damage models  
 - Useful for simulating the effects of different types of damage
 - Geometric models(chage in area)
 - Material parameter models (change in modulus or density, percent fraction or filament)
 - Impedance models

 ### Dynamic damage models
 - Predict the rate at which damage accumulates
 - General dynamic damage law 
   - incorporates both the internal load to component in the damaged area and the damage level  
 ### Failure models
- Based on maximum stress, maximum strain and other critera

 ### Performance models
- Model of finding useful life of the components
- Components reach the end of useful life long before they fail
